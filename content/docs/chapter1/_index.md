## Introduction


Tomatoes are one of my favorite plants to grow. Depending on the type of tomato plant, each plant may produce anywhere from 20-35 lbs of tomatoes per plant anually. There are many types to consider, which do you prefer?

- **cherry tomatoes**: perfect for snacking and minimal salad prep
- **san marzanos**: excellent for tomato sauces and pizza because of mild and sweet flavor
- **big beef tomatoes**: perfect for burgers, bacon lettuce tomatoe (BLT) sandwiches, salsa, caprese salad. Provides a firm texture with crisp.
- **sakura tomatoes**: all around medium size tomatoes for many uses


Furthermore, tomatoes can also be Indeterminate  or Determinate.
- **Indeterminate tomatoes** continue to grow while producing fruit
- **Determinate tomatoes** grow all thier fruit at a given time, then ripen fruit all together, then stop growing.

Chances are you already bought some. Otherwise check the section Seed list on the left regarding my favorite places to buy seeds.





## Starting


Tomato seeds should be placed in **50 cnt trays** . A tray roughly is about  21¼" x 11¼" x 2¼" or 19.6" x 9.75". Each cell within in the tray has dimensions: 1¾" x 1¾-2.72". This will provide a tomato seedling with ~6 weeks of growth. Larger size containers like egg cartons, small plastic cups can be used. Try not to plant tomoato seeds in smaller containers. They will out grow the space quickly and with more handling with young fragile seedlings, damage may result leading to a slow decay.
